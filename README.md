37-in-1 sensor kit for Arduino is available from many sellers
on Amazon, Ebay and AliExpress. The kit comes with 37 parts
mounted on small circuit boards in a 6x6 plastic box.
Not everything is a sensor, there are many parts that are actuators.

This repository is a collection of examples and information on
how to use the sensors and actuators with [RetroBSD](http://retrobsd.org).

# Duinomite board

Examples in this software package were designed for
[Olimex Duinomite board](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Duinomite/DUINOMITE/open-source-hardware).
You can use them with any other board as well, with minor changes.
Other boards usually have different assigment of i/o pins to logical signals.
Port names, signal indexes and masks have to be modified according to
schematics of a particular target board.
